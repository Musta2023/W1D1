SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( 5) 
return==>2

Q3:

SELECT COUNT(*) 
 FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN (5,null)returns==>0 "every comparaison with 'null' is unkown"

Q4:


( SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id IS NOT NULL )==>5
SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN (5)==>2
